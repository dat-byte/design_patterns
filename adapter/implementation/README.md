Simplifying Adaptee Interface for Adapter PatternWhen using the Adapter pattern, the first step is to identify the essential methods needed from the existing class (Adaptee). This "narrow" interface should include only a few key methods. A simpler interface makes it easier to create an adapter.


Using Abstract Operations: In this approach, we define abstract methods in the adapter interface that correspond to the operations needed from the Adaptee. Concrete adapters implement these methods by calling specific operations of the Adaptee.

```java
// Adapter Interface
public interface Adapter {
    void operation1();
    void operation2();
}

// Adaptee Interface
public interface Adaptee {
    void specificOperation1();
    void specificOperation2();
}

// Concrete Adapter
public class ConcreteAdapter implements Adapter {
    private final Adaptee adaptee;
    
    public ConcreteAdapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void operation1() {
        adaptee.specificOperation1();
    }
    
    @Override
    public void operation2() {
        adaptee.specificOperation2();
    }
}
```

Using Delegate Objects: Here, the adapter class contains an instance of the Adaptee. The adapter methods simply delegate the calls to the corresponding methods of the Adaptee instance.

```java
// Adapter Class
public class Adapter {
    private final Adaptee adaptee;
    
    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }
    
    public void operation1() {
        adaptee.specificOperation1();
    }
    
    public void operation2() {
        adaptee.specificOperation2();
    }
}
```

Parameterized Adapters: This approach allows us to pass the Adaptee object as a parameter to the adapter methods. The adapter methods directly call the specific operations of the Adaptee

```java
// Adapter Class
public class Adapter {
    public void operation1(Adaptee adaptee) {
        adaptee.specificOperation1();
    }
    
    public void operation2(Adaptee adaptee) {
        adaptee.specificOperation2();
    }
}
```
